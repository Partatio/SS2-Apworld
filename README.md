# System Shock 2 Archipelago AP world
An AP world for System Shock 2.  Randomizes items, enemies, and replicators.  Optionally randomizes all Stats and psi abilities, and/or os upgrades.  Takes about 4-6 hours to complete a run.

## Requirements
[Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en) v0.5.1 or higher.

The latest [release](https://github.com/Partatio/SS2-Apworld/releases) of the AP world, both the player and the person generating the world need this.

System Shock 2 with [SS2Tool](https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=4141.0) and [SCP beta7](https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=7116.0) installed.  AE does not need either of these.

The latest [release](https://github.com/Partatio/SS2-Apworld/releases) of the Archipelago System Shock 2 mod. It is the .7z file for classic and the .kpf file for AE.

## Installation
Install the AP world by opening it with Archipelago, or using Install APWorld in the Archipelago Launcher, or by manually placing it in Archipelago/custom_worlds.

#### Classic
Install SCP beta7 and the Archipelago mod using [ss2bmm](https://pshjt.github.io/dmm/) included with the SS2Tool installation.  Make sure to activate them and put SCP_beta7 at the lowest priority.

#### Anniversary edition
Put the .kpf file into your mods folder in your SS2 installation.  When starting a new game make sure to enable the Archipelago mod in the mods menu.

## Use
Follow the Achipelago setup guide to get a game generated and hosted, the yaml can be found in the releases page or by generating the template with the Archipelago Launcher.  The game must be generated locally and by someone with this AP world installed.

Start the System Shock 2 Client from the Archipelago Launcher.  It will check if you have an SS2 installation at the path designated in host.yaml in your Archipelago installation, if you don't you will be prompted to select your SS2 install folder.
The default path is AE installed with steam in it's default install location.  If you want to change from classic to AE or vice-versa you need to change the path in host.yaml.

Connect to the world with the client.  You must always start the client and connect to the slot before starting a game or loading a save in System Shock 2.

Start a new game and enjoy the horrors!

## Tips
Keypads wont work unless you have the relevant audio log/email.  You can tell you have it if the correct code for the keypad appears when you hover over it.  The tutorial keypad is exempt.  Hackable keypads can be hacked but can not have their code put in.  The transmitter code cannot be input until you have found the 4 parts of the code in the art terminals.

Locations on the map that seem to not be there are probably in enemies roaming around, or hidden above you.

Donâ€™t lose progression items, if you have included chemicals in the pool that includes the first vanadium and 2 antimony you get.

You can mantle on the Metacreative barrier psi ability and also stack them.  This gives you access to many locations including the deck 5 crew area without needing the deck 5 crew access card.

If stat/psi ability randomization is off then the respec machine is an invaluable tool letting you refund all spent cyber modules and reallocate them as needed.
